# Network_Analysis
Code (pipeline and statistical analysis) used to run Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis on 3500&lt; proteins measured in mouse models of longevity

WGCNA - R code run in Jupyter Notebooks to analyze MS proteomics data (3969 proteins, 48 samples)
      performs soft threshold analysis to optimize parameters for approximating a scale free topology
      performs clustering (identification of modules of tightly interconnected proteins in the larger measured network)
      calculates module eigenvectors for further statistical analysis
